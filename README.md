# Static Comp 2
This goal of this project is to recreate job posting in order to practice `flex-box` and `grid`.

## Description
We were given control over the copy, colors, and images. However, I chose to leave the original styles unchanged. The main layout was created using nested `grid` containers, and some individual layouts were aligned using `flex`.

The project is created with HTML and CSS, and responds properly to resizing the window, as well as mobile viewports down to 320px width. Charts were created with the Chart.js library, and applied to `<canvas>` elements.

Below is the original comp to replicate:
